#BrewBio
BrewBio is the place to organize and manage your homebrew. Store recipes, rate your brew and schedule next brewing session are a few of the features to come in BrewBio.

##Run BrewBio
The project's skeleton was created using Yeoman. To run this project, clone it and run ```grunt serve``` and that should do the trick.
